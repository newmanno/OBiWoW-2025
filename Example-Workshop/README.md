# Workshop Title
This is an example repository for how to organize your workshop content. In
this space, we have pre-populated the workshop description and authors. Feel
free to edit the README and the files in your workshop directory as you
see fit. We encourage you to include instructions on how to prepare for the
workshop ahead of time (e.g., where to get necessary software, etc.) and to
schedule a live troubleshooting session the day before your workshop.

You can add scripts, data files, instructions, etc. as files in this repo. If
you prefer, you can link in the README file to external resources where they
can access these files.
